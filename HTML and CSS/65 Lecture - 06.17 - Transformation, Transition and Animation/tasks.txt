  Tasks:
    1) Create a button. Then you hover over it, it's background and text color would change in very short amount of time. Maybe some other styles would change as well.
    2) Create element levitation animation. (element moving up, moving down and repeats constantly).
    extra 3) Try to repeat the viggling (needs skew()) of elements used in CSS Diner game. (https://flukeout.github.io/)
